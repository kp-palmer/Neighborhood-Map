# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

## Code from external sources
CSS 
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css (CSS for the sidebar)

JS 
knockout-3.4.2.js (Knockout framework)

## APIs
I used the Google Maps API is to show the map and markers. I used the Foursquare API is to get information about 10 bubble tea shops in New York City. It also provides information about their websites, addresses, and phone numbers.

## The Best of Boba
This application presents users with a Google Map populated with 10 of NYC's bubble tea shops. You can use the searchbar to filter through the list of shops. When you click on one of the shops in the sidebar, you will see an infowindow popup that has basic information about each store. 

## How to Run
Once you are connected to the internet, download all the files and open index.html in your browser. Or, view it live [here](https://kp-palmer.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/).
